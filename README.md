# Companies web service

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/davidc6/companies-service.svg?token=rQoC61ZuGqZDdxu3Y8ZD&branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/davidc6/companies-service)

:construction::construction_worker: Work in progress :construction::construction_worker:

This is an example of a web service in Node.js.

Current demo url - https://companies-service.herokuapp.com/

## Logging

The current version of the service logs to console only. A proper logging service should be used in production. On top of that more sensitive information (such as ip address, user agent, etc.) should be logged.

### Todo list:

- Documentation (needs updating)
- Content negotiation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation)
